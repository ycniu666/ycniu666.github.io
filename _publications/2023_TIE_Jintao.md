Abstract: Existing circuits for composite optimization problems tend to ignore the structure of nonsmooth objectives and lead to less practicability. To this end, with a proximal projection neural network (PPNN) and an inertial proximal projection neural network (IPPNN), this article presents two novel analog circuit frameworks in presence of a nonsmooth term, where the actions of neurons are simulated via a feedback loop formed by integrator, gradient estimate, proximal operator, and other basic operation models. In our circiuts, it shows that the stable output voltages are mapped to optimal solutions. Considering the nonsmooth term as l1 -norm, we further design an effective analog circuit of soft thresholding operator. Theoretically, it is proved that both PPNN-based and IPPNN-based analog circuit frameworks have stable output voltages in the sense that the value of electronic components meets a certain mild proportion. Finally, two examples are simulated on Multisim 14.0 platform to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed analog circuits.
